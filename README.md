# Java Springboot Compact
This my sample of Spring Boot for back-end application

# Features
Currently i use some libraries to complete my application
- JWT = Generating and validating token 
- JPA = Object and Entity mapper
- REST = JSON as a response
- Lombok = @Slf4j for log, @Data to reducing setter getter code at entity class
- Inceptor = Logging and validating token before entering the controller
- Exception Handler = give the response when there is an error
- Log file with date = archive log by date

In the future i will implementing Jyspt for properties encrytion and Adding Interceptor to validate signature
